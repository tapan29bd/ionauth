CodeIgniter with Ion Auth
#########################

This is a test project with Ion Auth over CodeIgniter 3.0.3

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
